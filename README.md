## About the Dataset 📊

- Download the dataset from here: <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data'>Kaggel Dataset</a> 



- In a competitive retail environment, understanding customer behavior is paramount to enhancing customer satisfaction, improving marketing strategies, and boosting sales. Retail stores accumulate extensive data on customer purchases, which can be analyzed to uncover patterns and trends. However, the sheer volume of data can make it challenging to draw actionable insights without appropriate data analysis techniques.

- You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

## Key Variables 🏡

- `CustomerID` ->  Unique ID assigned to the customer.
- `Gender` ->  Gender of the customer.
- `Age` ->  Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income` ->  Annual Income of the customer scaled to 1000$
- `Spending Score` ->  Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

## Clustering 🧩

- Clustering is done based on `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`
